CocktailDB API used with rest

Simple usgae of thecocktaildb.com api which allows getting random cocktail, or cocktail by name or by ingrediant search.

Why cocktaildb?

As a college student I am familiar with some of the drinks and given that I live in a student accommodation I am familiar with get togethers (House Partyâ€™s). One of the most important part of those get togethers is throwing a drink together whether it is making something delicious or something so disgusting that you black out as soon as you taste it. Either way at the end of one of these sessions I am left with a different mix of ingredients like Fireball or Vermouth. 
With this API it is easy to find cocktails based on ingredients or finding a random cocktail I want to learn today. Or it might be one of the cocktails I knew at one point, but I have forgotten now so I can just search it by its name.
With this API it makes everything stated above really easy and it offers a database of 635 Cocktails.
Also given the easy-to-understand documentation and a forum of its own its easy to tackle problems and it also gives the free option that outputs JSON which was something i was looking to build my skill on.
